6502 Emulator Goals

* Able to execute ALL Legal 6502 OpCodes
* Read a binary from a file to execute
* Read and write to a virtual memory struct
* Easy API that can be integrated with a GUI later or other components
* Software only (Don't clutter with hardware compatible for now but make writing functions abstracted)

Note : All memory functions to be accessed THROUGH the CPU -> Allows decoupling
